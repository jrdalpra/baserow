# Justfile Development Workflow

Baserow uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. There are two justfiles:

- **Root justfile** (`/justfile`) - Docker Compose commands and delegates to component justfiles
- **Backend justfile** (`/backend/justfile`) - Backend-specific commands using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python

## Installation

### macOS

```bash
# Install just
brew install just

# Install uv (for backend development)
brew install uv
```

### Linux

```bash
# Install just
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin

# Install uv (for backend development)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.

### Windows (WSL)

Use the Linux instructions above within WSL.

## Project Root Commands

From the project root, you can run Docker Compose commands and delegate to backend commands.

### Docker Compose

Two flexible commands that pass through to `docker compose`:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just dc <cmd> [args]` | Production compose (docker-compose.yml) |
| `just dc-dev <cmd> [args]` | Dev compose (includes docker-compose.dev.yml) |

Examples:

```bash
# Build dev images
just dc-dev build --parallel

# Start dev environment (detached)
just dc-dev up -d

# Start specific services only
just dc-dev up -d backend db redis

# View logs (follow mode)
just dc-dev logs -f backend

# Open shell in container (with correct UID/GID for file permissions)
just dc-dev shell backend bash

# Open shell as container user (may have permission issues with mounted files)
just dc-dev exec backend bash

# Run command in container
just dc-dev exec backend python manage.py migrate

# Stop containers
just dc-dev down

# Show running containers
just dc-dev ps

# Restart a service
just dc-dev restart backend

# Production commands
just dc up -d
just dc build --parallel
```

### Viewing Logs

The `just logs` command provides a unified way to view logs from Docker containers or local processes:

```bash
# View all backend logs (backend + celery)
just logs

# View specific services
just logs backend          # Backend only
just logs celery           # All celery workers
just logs frontend         # Web frontend
just logs backend celery   # Multiple services

# With options
just logs -f               # Follow logs (like tail -f)
just logs -n 100           # Last 100 lines
just logs -f backend       # Follow backend logs only
```

The command automatically detects whether you're running Docker or local processes:
- **Docker**: Uses `docker compose logs` (celery expands to celery + celery-export-worker + celery-beat-worker)
- **Local**: Tails log files from `/tmp/baserow-*.log`

### Calling Backend Commands from Root

You can call any backend command from the project root using `just b`:

```bash
# Run backend commands from project root
just b init        # Initialize backend
just b test        # Run tests
just b lint        # Run linter
just b run-dev     # Start dev server

# These are equivalent
just b init
just backend init
```

---

## Backend Commands

The following commands are available in the backend justfile. Run them from the `backend/` directory, or from the project root using `just b <command>`.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd backend

# Initialize everything (creates venv, locks deps, installs)
just init

# Run the development server
just run-dev-server

# Run Celery workers (in another terminal)
just run-dev-celery
```

Or from project root:

```bash
just b init
just b run-dev-server
just b run-dev-celery
```

### Environment Configuration

Baserow uses different env files for different purposes:

| File | Purpose | Created by |
|------|---------|------------|
| `.env.local` | Local development (native Python) | Auto-created by `just b init` |
| `.env.docker-dev` | Docker development | Auto-created by `just dc-dev` |
| `.env` | Production Docker | Copy from `.env.example` |

**For local development** (running Python natively):
- `just b init` creates `.env.local` from `.env.local.example`
- All `just b` commands automatically source `.env.local` if present
- Contains: `DATABASE_HOST=localhost`, `REDIS_HOST=localhost`, debug settings

**For Docker development**:
- `just dc-dev` creates `.env.docker-dev` from `.env.docker-dev.example`
- Contains: UID/GID for permissions, Docker networking URLs

#### Using direnv (optional)

For automatic environment loading when entering the directory, use [direnv](https://direnv.net/):

```bash
# Install direnv
brew install direnv  # macOS
# or: apt install direnv  # Linux

# Add to your shell config (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"  # or zsh

# Allow the project's .envrc
direnv allow
```

The `.envrc` file loads `.env.local` and activates the venv automatically.

| `just format` | Format code with black |
| `just sort` | Sort imports with isort |
| `just fix` | Fix code style (sort + format) |

### Testing

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just test` | Run tests |
| `just test -n=auto` | Run tests in parallel |
| `just test tests/path` | Run specific tests |
| `just test-coverage` | Run tests with coverage report |
| `just test-builder` | Run builder-specific tests |
| `just test-automation` | Run automation-specific tests |

#### Test Settings

Test settings (`settings/test.py`) are designed for consistency and flexibility:

- **DATABASE_* and REDIS_*** vars can be passed via environment variables
- **All other settings** are hardcoded in test.py to ensure consistent test behavior
- **Optional TEST_ENV_FILE** can be used to load settings from a file

```bash
# Pass database directly via env var
DATABASE_URL=postgres://baserow:baserow@localhost:5433/baserow just b test

# Or use an env file
TEST_ENV_FILE=.env.testing-local just b test
```

This allows tests to run identically inside Docker (using container hostnames) and locally (using localhost).

### Test Database (Ramdisk)

For significantly faster tests, use a PostgreSQL container with tmpfs (in-memory storage). This eliminates disk I/O and can speed up tests by 2-5x.

> **Note:** The `just test-db` command is **host-only**. It starts a separate Docker container and cannot be run from inside another container. When running tests inside the backend container, use the existing `db` service instead.

```bash
# Start test database on port 5433 (always recreates for fresh state)
just test-db
```

The test database runs with optimized settings:
- **tmpfs storage**: All data in RAM (8GB allocated)
- **Disabled fsync/WAL**: No durability overhead
- **Disabled autovacuum**: No background maintenance
- **Large shared_buffers**: 512MB for better caching

#### Running Tests Against the Ramdisk Database

```bash
# Pass DATABASE_URL directly
DATABASE_URL=postgres://baserow:baserow@localhost:5433/baserow just b test

# Run parallel tests against ramdisk
DATABASE_URL=postgres://baserow:baserow@localhost:5433/baserow just b test -n=auto
```

#### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TEST_DB_PORT` | 5433 | Host port for the test database |

```bash
# Use a different port
TEST_DB_PORT=5434 just test-db
```

The container is named `baserow-test-db` and uses the `pgvector/pgvector:pg13` image.

### Celery Development

The `run-dev-celery` command runs all Celery components together with colored output:

- **WORKER** (cyan): Main worker for celery and automation_workflow queues
- **EXPORT** (green): Export worker
- **BEAT** (yellow): Scheduler with redbeat

Press Ctrl+C to stop all workers.

```

## Differences from Docker Development

| Aspect | Justfile (local) | Docker |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Python env | Local venv via uv | Container venv |
| Services | External (Redis, PostgreSQL) | docker-compose managed |
| Hot reload | Native file watching | Volume mounts |
| Debugging | Direct IDE integration | Remote debugging |

For services like Redis and PostgreSQL, either:
- Run them locally
- Use `just dc-dev up db redis` to start just the services
- Use the test database: `just test-db-start`

## Shell Completion

### The Tradeoff

`just` provides convenient, documented commands but **does not support shell tab-completion** for command arguments. This is because tab completion happens in your shell *before* the command runs, so the shell doesn't know that `just b test` will eventually run `pytest`.

For example, when you type:
```bash
just b test ../enterpr<TAB>   # No completion - shell doesn't know about pytest
```

If you need tab completion (e.g., for file paths), use the underlying command directly from the `backend/` directory:
```bash
source ../.env.local && uv run pytest ../enterpr<TAB>   # Completes to ../enterprise/
```

### Running Commands Directly

For local development with bash completion, you can bypass `just` and run commands directly. You'll need to:

1. **Load environment variables** from `.env.local` (in project root)
2. **Use `uv run`** to execute in the venv

From the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# Option 1: Source env and run (one-liner)
source ../.env.local && uv run pytest ../enterprise/backend/tests/

# Option 2: Use direnv (automatic - recommended)
# If you have direnv set up, .env.local is already loaded
uv run pytest ../enterprise/backend/tests/

# Option 3: Activate venv first
source ../.venv/bin/activate
source ../.env.local  # or use direnv
pytest ../enterprise/backend/tests/
```

### Loading and Clearing Environment Variables

Use these just recipes to manage environment variables in your shell:

```bash
# Load .env.local into current shell
eval "$(just env-load)"

# Clear all variables from .env.local
eval "$(just env-clear)"

# Alternative: start a fresh shell (loses all changes)
exec bash
```

**Note:** The recipes output commands that you `eval` because just runs in a subshell and can't modify your parent shell directly.

If using **direnv**, it automatically loads/unsets variables when you enter/leave the directory.

### When to Use Each Approach

| Use `just` when... | Use direct commands when... |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Running standard tasks | You need tab completion for paths |
| Sharing commands with teammates | Debugging/exploring interactively |
| CI/CD scripts | You know the exact command already |
| You don't need completion | IDE integration |

### Installing just Completions

While `just` can't complete *arguments* to the underlying commands, it can complete recipe names:

```bash
# Bash
just --completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/just

# Zsh
just --completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_just
# Add to ~/.zshrc: fpath=(~/.zfunc $fpath)

# Fish
just --completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/just.fish
```

After installation, `just b <TAB>` will complete recipe names like `test`, `lint`, `run-dev-server`, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### "Dev environment not found"

Run `just init` to set up the environment.

### Import errors after pulling changes

```bash
just sync  # Re-sync dependencies
```

### Permission errors

Ensure you own the `.venv` directory:

```bash
just venv-clean
just init
```

### Celery crashes on macOS

The justfile defaults to `solo` pool on macOS to avoid fork() issues. If you need different behavior:

```bash
CELERY_POOL=threads just run-dev-celery
```
